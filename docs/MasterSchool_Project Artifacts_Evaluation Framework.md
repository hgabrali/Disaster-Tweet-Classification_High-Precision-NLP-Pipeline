# 📁 Project Artifacts & Evaluation Framework

This repository outlines the mandatory technical and analytical artifacts required for the completion of the NLP project, alongside the specific criteria for the live presentation and quality assessment.

## 💻 Technical Artifacts: Google Colab Implementation

The primary deliverable is a **Google Colab notebook** acting as the central workspace for the end-to-end NLP pipeline. The notebook must be structured with clear, readable code and integrated explanatory Markdown.

### **Pipeline Components**
1.  **Data Loading & Inspection**: Initial ingestion and exploratory analysis of the target dataset.
2.  **Text Preprocessing**: Implementation of systematic cleaning and normalization steps.
3.  **Text Vectorization**: Transformation of processed text into numerical representations (Feature Engineering).
4.  **Model Training & Evaluation**: Execution of the learning algorithm and quantitative assessment of performance.

## 🧠 Analytical Reasoning & Documentation

The project emphasizes **clarity of thinking** over code volume or complexity. The following explanations must be embedded directly within the notebook's Markdown cells:

* **Modeling Choices**: Justification for the selected architecture and algorithms.
* **Technical Trade-offs**: Discussion on the balance between performance, speed, and complexity.
* **Result Interpretation**: Detailed analysis of what the metrics indicate regarding model efficacy.
* **Approach Limitations**: Honest assessment of the constraints and potential biases of the implementation.

## 🎤 Presentation Context: Live Defense

A mandatory live presentation is required. This session focuses on **reasoning, interpretation, and insight** rather than a step-by-step code walkthrough.

### **Key Discussion Areas**
* **Problem Significance**: Defining the problem space and its real-world impact.
* **Methodological Approach**: Explaining the rationale behind specific preprocessing and feature extraction techniques.
* **Model Selection**: Defending the choice of a particular model over alternatives.
* **Evaluation Insight**: Interpreting results and identifying specific strengths and failure modes of the model.

## ⚖️ Quality Expectations & Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated based on the depth of understanding and the appropriateness of technical choices. **Note: Higher complexity does not imply higher quality.**

| Evaluation Pillar | Expectation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NLP Problem Mastery** | Demonstrating a deep understanding of the specific NLP challenge. |
| **Methodological Fit** | Appropriateness of preprocessing and modeling choices for the given data. |
| **Metric Accuracy** | Correct application and interpretation of evaluation metrics. |
| **Behavioral Reasoning** | Ability to explain why the model behaves the way it does. |
| **Communication** | Clear, structured, and insightful delivery of findings. |
